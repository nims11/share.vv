share.vv
========

webRTC file sharing

## Setting up

```
# git clone git@github.com:nims11/share.vv.git
# cd share.vv/
# npm install socket.io
# node server.js
```
A HTTP server having access to share.vv is required. Simplest would be to run inside `share.vv/`
```
# python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Now open up `localhost:8000` to test if working.
